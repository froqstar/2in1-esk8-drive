A parametric 3D design for single-motor, dual driven wheel electric skateboards

## What is this about?

This is a parametric 3D design for a electric skateboard motor mount. 
The feature that sets it apart is that it allows to use one motor to drive two wheels of a skateboard, 
giving it more traction especially in cornering.

The parts generated by the OpenSCAD script are shown below:

## Features

- Dual wheel drive with one brushless DC motor/ESC
- Completely parametric, adjustable to your existing hardware
- Vibration-dampened (the parts touching the truck are expected to be printed in TPU)
- Variable mount-to-truck angle
- Belt-tensioning via setscrew

## How do I make this work for my board?

As the design is parametric, almost all parameters can be adjusted according to your setup.
This includes truck and motor dimensions, as well as the type and length of belt used, the number of teeth on your 
pulleys, the diameters of your screws and how sturdy you want the design to be. So just about everything.

The only thing probably requiring some work on your side is the TPU adapter to make it fit to your truck.
Due to the plethora of truck shapes out there and me only having my single board, 
I couldn't model them myself. By default, an adapter for Globe Slant Reverse Kingpin Trucks is included.
Take the output of `truckAdapterBase()` as a base for your own truck adapter.

## Hardware BOM

- A suitable BLDC motor (The current script has the values for a Turnigy Aerodrive SK3 6474 motor)
- Mounting screws for the motor (should be included)
- Two drive belts (HTD5M or similar, 12mm width or more recommended)
- Two wheel & two motor pulleys, fitting your belts.
- A new axle for your motor! As most motors don't support pulleys on both sides, you'll likely need to replace the motor axle with a longer one that protrudes from both ends of the motor. I made one myself.
- 4 screws and locknuts of suitable length and strength (e.g. M3 40mm) to fasten the big parts around the TPU parts.
- 1 screw and locknut to adjust the belt tension on the non-supported motor side. M3 is fine, length depends on the rest of your hardware/parameters.
- 1 bearing for the motor axle. If your motor axle is 8mm in diameter, a standard 608 skateboard bearing is fine.
- Two pieces of threaded rod (e.g. M8) as long as your truck axle is wide, with 8 matching nuts (preferably locknuts) to adjust the distance between the two sides of the mount.  

## Assembly

### Printing the parts
Once you have put in your measurements, all you need to do is open the supplied .scad file with OpenSCAD, generate the STL files and print them.
All parts are expected to be printed in PETG or similar (PLA is not recommended due to it being brittle and having low tolerance for motor heat), except for the truck adapter (the round thing), which is expected to be printed in TPU to make it pressure-fit tightly on the truck and offer vibration dampening for the whole assembly.
Print one of each PETG part, and two TPU truck adapters.

### Steps

1. Slip the truck adapters on your truck.
2. Loosely attach the motor to the mount through the 4 mounting holes.
3. Put in the screws and nuts that are used to fasten the mount around the adapters. Don't tighten them yet, or you won't be able to attach the parts to the truck!
4. Slip the motor mount over the truck adapter in the desired angle and make sure the mount doesn't touch your board when cornering.
5. Put the motor axle bearing in the bearing sleigh, and insert the locknut in the slot. Then, put the bearing sleigh into the cavity in the mount part, bearing-first and with the locknut facing the hole for the tensioning screw. Screw the tensioning screw into the nut.
6. Slip the mount on the other truck adapter on the truck and fit the motor axle in the bearing.
7. Put the threaded rods through the holes at the front and the back parts of the mount, making sure not to forget to put on the two nuts in the middle.
8. Adjust the distance between the mounts.
9. Fasten the mounts around the truck adapters by tightening the four screws.
10. Put on your pulleys, wheels and belts and tension accordingly.
11. Profit :)
